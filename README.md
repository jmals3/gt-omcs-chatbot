# GT Chatbot

## Objective
The goal of this project was to create a Chatbot capable of maintaining a conversation about Georgia Tech’s Online Masters of Computer Science program for 5 minutes.  The bot offers information to frequently asked questions about the program.  The bot is not meant for routine dialogue, but rather serves the purpose of an informational resource.

## Tools Used
- C# – programming language used
- Microsoft Bot Framework – provides tools to handle basic I/O, dialogue skills, language skills, and connection with users
- LUIS – machine learning backbone to the bot framework that identifies intents and entities from user input
- SQL Server – database used
- Azure – backend host which supports the bot on multiple platforms
- Skype – the primary interface used to interact with the bot
